OpenTox model
=============

* An OpenTox REST Webservice (http://www.opentox.org)
* Implements the OpenTox model API 
* Ruby implementation of lazar prediction models

REST operations:

Get a list of all lazar models          GET     /     -               List of model URIs          200
Get the representation of a lazar model GET     /{id} -               Model representation        200,404
Predict a compound                      POST    /{id} compound_uri    Prediction representation   200,404,500
Predict a dataset                       POST    /{id} dataset_uri     Prediction dataset URI      200,404,500
Delete a model                          DELETE  /{id} -               -                           200,404

Supported MIME formats (http://chemical-mime.sourceforge.net/):

  * application/rdf+xml (default): read/write OWL-DL
  * application/x-yaml 

Examples:

List all lazar models
  curl http://webservices.in-silico.ch/test/model

Get the representation of a lazar model
  curl -H "Accept:application/rdf+xml" http://webservices.in-silico.ch/test/model/{id}

Predict a compound
  curl -X POST -d compound_uri={compound_uri} http://webservices.in-silico.ch/test/model/{id}

Predict a compound and get the result as YAML
  curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/x-yaml" -d compound_uri={compound_uri} http://webservices.in-silico.ch/test/model/{id}

Predict a dataset
  curl -X POST -d dataset_uri={dataset_uri} http://webservices.in-silico.ch/test/model/{id}

Delete a model
  curl -X DELETE http://webservices.in-silico.ch/test/model/{id}
